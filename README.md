# TenFingerTyping
Implementation of TypeAnywhere

### Decoder
You can directly run `socketio_client.py` under `decoder/` to test the app. The modal weight is already included in the path.

There are also training scripts in the `decoder/` path

### Webapp
You can run the webapp for the typing demo. 

Run the server first and then run the python tap receiver; then run the decoder (the deocder is a socket-io client) to  begin typing.
