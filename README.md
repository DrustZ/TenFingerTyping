# TenFingerTyping
Implementation of TypeAnywhere

### Decoder
You can directly run `socketio_client.py` under `decoder/` to test the app. The modal weight can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HP7zbijsYhrpu5fJdEtURdhZcFvIhnGw/view?usp=sharing).

There are also training scripts in the `decoder/` path

### Webapp
You can run the webapp for the typing demo. 

Run the server first and then run the python tap receiver; then run the decoder (the deocder is a socket-io client) to  begin typing.
